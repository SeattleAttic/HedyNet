<p>We're building something new and cool in downtown Seattle - a feminist, woman-centered, and trans- and queer-inclusive space where tinkerers, makers, crafters, and hackers of all genders encourage each other to work, teach, learn, and collaborate.</p> 

<p>Does this sound relevant to your interests?  Sign up for our low-volume announcements list (via <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/seattle-attic-announce">web</a> or by emailing seattle-attic-announce+subscribe AT googlegroups DOT com) to hear when the space formally launches.</p>
