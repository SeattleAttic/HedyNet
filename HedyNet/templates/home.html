<p>This summer, a group of idealistic intersectional feminists started a 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerspace" data-tooltip class="has-tip" 
title="Via Wikipedia: A hackerspace (also referred to as a hacklab, makerspace, or hackspace) is a community-operated workspace where people with common interests, often in computers, technology, science, digital art or electronic art, can meet, socialize and/or collaborate.">hackerspace</a>
in downtown Seattle. We are a feminist, woman-centered, trans- and queer- inclusive space for tinkerers, 
makers, crafters and hackers of all genders. Our goal is to offer a safe, non-intimidating environment, 
tools, and a supportive, friendly community to help feminist makers and hackers learn and build.</p>
 
<p>Not long after we launched, other organizers started work on feminist hackerspaces in 
<a href="http://www.doubleunion.org/">San Francisco</a> and
<a href="http://fluxlab.io/">Portland</a>! We hope that this is the beginning of similar
spaces starting up in cities and towns across the world.</p>

<p>You can help make this happen: Come join us!</p>

<p>We are located at 600 First Ave, Unit 605. After hours, you can enter the building on the 
James Street side; look for the "Office Space" sign, and dial "Attic" on the intercom.</p>
 
<p>We hold a weekly open house on Tuesday evenings from 6:30-9PM. You can reach us for more 
information at <a href="mailto:info@seattleattic.com">info@seattleattic.com</a>. You can also sign 
up for our low-volume announcementslist (via web or by emailing 
seattle-attic-announce+subscribe AT googlegroups DOT com) to get updates about our events.</p>

<p>If you want to start a similar space in your city, do contact us so that we can share our 
knowledge and experience with you.</p>
