## Our Mission

The Seattle Attic Community Workshop is a place where people of any gender gather to learn and create. We are a feminist and woman-centered community that actively welcomes participants of all racial and cultural backgrounds and levels of ability.


## Our Vision

As feminists, we are building a sustainable community where we hone our skills, share work, and learn to treat each other well. We draw strength and inspiration from the Attic as we take on the world.


## Our Code of Conduct

The Seattle Attic Community Workshop is an inclusive and welcoming space with a feminist ethos. We value each member's experiences. The presence of multiple viewpoints strengthens our community, advances our vision, and supports our pursuit of productivity, personal goals, dignity and self-respect.

As a member or guest of the Seattle Attic Community Workshop, you agree to act with respect towards everyone in the space regardless of:  

* Chosen craft 
* Preferred tools
* Experience, ability, or interest
* Gender or gender expression
* Body size
* Race, color, or origin
* Sexual orientation
* Belief system
* Age

 
## Guidelines for respectful interaction

* Treat other people as they would like to be treated. If you do not know how, ask them.
* Yes means yes, no means no, and maybe also means no. Accept an answer of “no” without arguing. Say “yes” when you mean yes.
* Respect others’ personal space and possessions. Ask before you touch someone or their belongings.
* Respect chosen names/pronouns/genders.
* Act from an assumption of mutual respect and good will. Clarify misunderstandings, apologize for harm caused, and assume ignorance rather than malice.
* Watch out for each other.  Maintaining a respectful and safe community is everybody’s responsibility.
 

## Harassment

All forms of harassment, including sexual harassment, are unacceptable here.
Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, or other protected class status; sexual images in public spaces; deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following; harassing photography or recording; repeated interruption; repeated violation of an individual's stated boundaries; inappropriate physical contact, unwanted intrusion into an individual's personal items or computer systems; and unwelcome sexual attention of any form. Individuals asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. Any Attic member may ask any non-member to leave at any time.


## Threats and Violence

Violence or threats of any kind will result in immediate ejection and revocation of membership without refund of dues. Bringing firearms into the Workshop is strictly prohibited. Blades are to be treated with respect at all times and properly secured when not in use. Deliberately unsafe use of any tools or projects will result in immediate ejection.


## Reprisals and confidentiality

If a member raises a concern relating to actions covered by this policy in good faith, there will be no retaliation for bringing forward their concern. Threatening or taking action against a member for invoking this policy and/or for participating in any related investigation will be considered a violation of this policy.

All concerns relating to harassment, including sexual harassment, will be dealt with as confidentially as possible. A member’s identity or the circumstances regarding any concern or complaint will not be disclosed unless disclosure is necessary for the purposes of investigating or taking disciplinary action.

## If conflict or harassment occurs

If conflict arises with another member, consider addressing it with them directly. Request that they stop the problematic behavior. If it seems necessary and you feel comfortable doing so, explain the negative impact of their behavior.

If this is not possible, consider asking a neutral party to mediate. When both parties are attempting to act with respect and good will, most conflicts can be resolved without escalation.

If the behavior is egregious, you believe that the behavior would only be redirected at others, you feel that direct communication is unsafe or otherwise inappropriate, or if the steps above have failed to resolve the situation, you should contact:

* Jacqueline Ashwell, Seattle Attic President: jacqueline.a.lott@gmail.com
* The alternative nonboard contact listed on the CoC hanging in the space

Anyone who becomes aware of an incident of harassment is encouraged to make such a written report. 

The board will take appropriate action as soon as reasonably possible. Possible actions include: a verbal or written warning, temporary suspension of access to the Workshop, and termination of membership without refund of dues.

The board shall keep records of all such incidents brought to its attention and the actions taken in response.

This document will be posted online at www.seattleattic.com/policies/conduct and in the space near the Workshop entrance. It is your responsibility to be aware of any and all changes to this document when they occur and to instigate changes to this policy as necessary.
